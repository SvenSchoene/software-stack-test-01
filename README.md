# software-stack-test-01

In this repository I'm researching / evaluating / comparing / learning about / getting some experience with different front- and backend-stacks.

To do this I'm going to implement the same very simple forum software with the same limited feature set:

* User system with very simple profiles.
* User authentication.
* Forums...
* ...which can have threads...
* ...which can have posts/replies.
